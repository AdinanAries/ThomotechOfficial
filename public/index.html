                  businesses. Our business will start in Manhattan, Bronx,

                <p>
                  Queue is one of the services that TheoMo Technologies is
                  bringing to the retail and service providing business market.
                  Queue is a website that also has a mobile application
                  supported by Android and IOS operating systems. This service
                  is designed to help small businesses that do not have the
                  resources to create a website, mobile app and managed or
                  maintain them. Businesses that will use this service are
                  sorted when it comes to creating or scheduling appointments
                  for their customers because Queue provides them with a
                  platform that will be handling or setting up appointments for
                  their customers. Queue is a platform where smaller business
                  service providers such as barbershops, Primary care physician
                  offices, spa and salon and many more can open an account for
                  their businesses and customers will as well create an account
                  as a customer or an individual. Customers will use this
                  service for free however, businesses that use this service
                  will use it this service at a price. On this platform,
                  individuals can search for the services they need with the
                  options to minimize their search to a specific location and
                  type of service. The platform will then provide a list of
                  businesses providing services based on the locations of the
                  individual and the businesses on the platform. The benefit of
                  using Queue is that individuals will be able to see when the
                  business has an open slot and then book an appointment at any
                  time even when the business is closed, cancel an appointment
                  and also reschedule an appointment on the same platform.
                  Another benefit of using Queue as an individual is because you
                  will receive notifications and reminders of appointments. Some
                  advantages to businesses that use Queue is that they can edit
                  their availability time for appointment or service and also
                  hold a slot for a specific customer. Businesses can also take
                  payment for services provided via the Queue app. Also, Queue
                  will help organize the daily routine of small businesses.
                  Businesses can also communicate with their customers via the
                  Queue. TheoMo Technologies does not provide services directly
                  to individuals on Queue but rather to small businesses. Any
                  unsatisfied services received from a business provider
                  patronized through Queue must be resolved between the customer
                  and business provider. We are not liable for any business
                  service provider on our platform. To ensure that businesses on
                  Queue are providing the best and quality services, we have
                  made a provision where customers can rate businesses based on
                  their experience. Businesses that go below two stars rating
                  will be dropped from the platform.
