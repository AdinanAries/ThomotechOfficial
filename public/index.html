                  The Queue platform provides customers a list of businesses
                  providing services based on the location of the individual.
                  The benefit of using Queue is that individuals will be able to
                  see when the business has an open slot and then book an
                  appointment at any time.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Queue also has a built in online payments feature that allows
                  the businesses to accept upfront payments upon ordering their
                  services on the Queue software.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It is important to note that Queue is only a SAAS solution
                  intended to improve the lives the customers as well as help
                  the businesses grow and to well organize its daily operations.

                  We don't hold any authority over any particular business who
                  uses the Queue app, therefore, We are not liable for any
                  business on the platform. To ensure that businesses on Queue
                  are providing the best and quality services, we have made a
                  provision where customers can rate businesses based on their
                  experience.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Businesses that go below two stars rating will be dropped from
                  the platform. This is however, not a measure to weed
                  businesses out, but instead to encourage them to improve on
                  the quality of their services which consequently helps them to
                  attract more customers and increase their sales.

                  "Queue" is more than a scheduling app for businesses. "Queue"
                  is a marketing tool for businesses to get their business out
                  there to potential customers. One interesting thing about one
                  of the features of Queue is posting pictures of the services
                  they provided to customers. Businesses can use this feature
                  with captivating captions like “picture of the week” or “hair
                  cut of the week”. Any customer who searches for the type of
                  service you provide will see the pictures you posted for that
                  week and the pictures that most customers commented on.
                  Therefore, your business is reaching potential customers and
                  staying connected to your customers on the platform we
                  provide. "Queue" will help you prepare for the day ahead of
                  time. The customers that schedule the appointment also can
                  select a specific style they want. Hence, the business knows
                  ahead of time the number of customers they will be providing
                  services to.
